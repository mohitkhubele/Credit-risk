.import data from the given link
.import that data in msexcel
.check the dimention of the data 1000rows and 21column
.rename the column name 
.save data into csv fromat
.import that data into r studios
.first check head and tail of the data
.summary and structure of the data
.finding missing value
.convert the variable into a proper factor or numeric
.check class inbalance
.applying model with tunning
-Logistic regression model
-do step aic in logistic and set thresold value(0.5)
-predict on train and test and get confusion matrix and statistics of model
-Naivebayes model
-predict on train and test and get confusion matrix and statistics of model
-k-fold cross validation with cart
-predict on train and test and get confusion matrix and statistics of model
-Descion Tree model
-build a tree
-predict on train and test and get confusion matrix and statistics of model
-Random forest
--predict on train and test and get confusion matrix and statistics of model
-tunning of random forest
--again build a model and get test and train prediction to analyse with confusion matrix
-SVM model
-predict on train and test and get confusion matrix and statistics of model
-Ada boosting method
-predict on train and test and get confusion matrix and statistics of model


------best model is random forest giving 98 accuracy in train and test 77 slightly overfitting--------
